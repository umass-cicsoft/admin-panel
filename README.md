## Technology Stack

- **Flutter** (Dart): Ideal tooling for building multi-platform applications, especially in context of future projects.

- **Flask** (Python): CICapi is built on Flask, so we could either integrate it into this (monolith), or deploy as microservices.

- **Realtime Database** (Firebase): Currently, the members are stored on a Firebase Realtime Database instance.
